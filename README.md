This repository contains the implementation of a Tic Tac Toe game, which I developed during my internship at Prodigy Infotech. The project focuses on creating a responsive and interactive user experience, simulating the classic 2-player game in a modern web-based environment.

Features
Two-player mode: Play against another human player.
Simple and intuitive UI: Easy-to-use interface for all age groups.
Real-time gameplay: Immediate updates to the game board.
Win detection: Highlights the winning combination when the game is won.
Responsive design: Fully functional on both desktop and mobile devices.

Technologies Used
HTML5: For structuring the game elements.
CSS3: For styling the game board and layout.
JavaScript: For implementing game logic and interactivity.
